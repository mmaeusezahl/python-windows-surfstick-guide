# How to use a Huawei surfstick under Windows with python to send and receive SMS

## Scope of this guide

This guide is meant as starting point for users who want to send SMS from a
python script under Windows. There are quite some tutorials out there for
Linux and MacOS but nothing that worked for my specific circumstances.

This guide was written for a E3135 surfstick by Huawei. I believe that the
information provided here might help for other similar surfsticks as well.
There is quite a good list of similar devices in the [USB ModeSwitch article][1]
together with some starting point information in the ubuntuusers forum.

Possible applications (partially beyond the scope of this guide) include:
* Sending and receiving SMS with a Huawei surfstick
* Modeswitching the surfstick under Windows
* Doing other things a surf stick can do (e.g. phone calls, reading SIM contacts
using the surfstick
* ... ?
